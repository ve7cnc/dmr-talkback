# dmr-talkback

A DMR **voice test** endpoint. It connects to an HBP server exactly as an
ordinary repeater does, records one call, and plays it back so the caller can
hear how they sound.

Other networks call this a "parrot". This one doesn't.

It is a small, dependency-free C program. It is **not** part of HBlink3 or
HBlink4 — it is an endpoint that speaks the same protocol a repeater speaks, so
one binary works against HBlink3, HBlink4, FreeDMR, XLXD, or anything else that
serves the HomeBrew protocol.

---

## What it does

- Answers **group calls** on a talkgroup you choose, per timeslot.
- The reply goes back onto the same talkgroup, so everyone listening hears it.
- Every reply is sourced from the talkback's own radio ID, in the DMRD header
  **and** in the Link Control carried inside the voice payload, so radios and
  MMDVMHost display the talkback rather than the original caller.
- The audio is never re-encoded. AMBE comes back bit-for-bit as it went in.
- **The two timeslots are fully independent.** A caller on TS1 and a caller on
  TS2 are recorded and replayed at the same time without interfering.
- **One process runs as many instances as you like**, each connecting to its own
  server with its own talkgroups.

## Group calls only

Talkback is never addressed by radio ID, and private calls to it are ignored.

That is deliberate. Talkgroup numbers are yours: you hand them out inside your
own network and bound their reach with your own rules, and it costs nobody else
anything. Radio IDs are a globally administered namespace, and unit-call routing
is unbounded — a private call to an unknown ID floods until the target is found,
and the map that results is global. For talkback to be reachable by ID, every
instance anyone ever deployed would need its own globally unique registered
radio ID, for something that is neither a radio nor a repeater.

BrandMeister can use a private call to 9990 because BrandMeister is a single
network that is the sole authority over its own namespace. These tools assume an
internet of independent routers. The precedent doesn't transfer.

The practical upshot is good news: the talkback's radio ID never needs to be
reachable, so **one ID you already own can serve every instance you run.**

## Configuration

```toml
[global]
log_level = "INFO"

[instance.lawrence]
radio_id    = 3120099
slot1_tgid  = 0            # 0 or omitted = slot unused
slot2_tgid  = 9990
master_ip   = "127.0.0.1"
master_port = 54000
passphrase  = "s3cr37w0rd"
```

**One talkgroup per slot**, deliberately. A DMR timeslot carries one call at a
time, so a list would advertise capacity that doesn't exist. Two slots means
exactly two callers can be served at once, and the config says so plainly.

The slot talkgroups are also sent to the server as an RPTO subscription
(`TS1=…;TS2=…`) at login. That is not cosmetic: HBlink4 will not deliver a
talkgroup to a repeater that hasn't subscribed to it. HBlink3 ignores it.

See [talkback.toml.sample](talkback.toml.sample) for the fully commented
version.

### Running more than one instance

An HBlink3 server hosts several independent **systems**. Previously, giving all of
them a talkback means building a bridge that multiplexes every system into one
talkback engine — bridge rules to write, and one shared talkback that every
system contends for.

```toml
[instance.lawrence]
radio_id = 3120099
slot2_tgid = 9990
master_port = 54000
# ...

[instance.topeka]
radio_id = 3120098
slot2_tgid = 9991
master_port = 54010
# ...
```

Bridging everyone into a **single** instance is still perfectly valid if that's
the behavior you want — one talkback heard across several systems. Both work;
pick the one that matches how you want it to behave.

Two things to know:

- **Don't point one process at several different HBlink3 servers.** Instances
  are independent so it would function, but you've made one process a single
  point of failure for several servers and interleaved the logs of unrelated
  networks. Runing a process per server is must cleaner.
- **HBlink4 has no "system" concept** — the server is the unit. One instance per
  HBlink4 server is the only arrangement that makes sense.

**Sharing one radio ID across instances is fine**, and is the normal
arrangement — group-only talkback never has anything routed to its ID, so it
carries no addressing meaning. Six instances on six HBlink3 systems can all use
the same ID. Do not connect two talkback instances to the same HBlink3 system or
HBlink4 without using different radio IDs for each -- though one would wonder why
you might do this -- hey, I won't judge!

## Playlist mode (this fork)

An instance with a `playlist_dir` is a **player** instead of a talkback: every
`playlist_interval_secs` each of its slots plays the next pre-encoded AMBE file
from the directory (and its immediate subdirectories) as a group call on its
talkgroup, from the instance's radio ID. Inbound calls are ignored. It's meant
for repeatable audio-quality and network tests: the same AMBE goes out
bit-identical every time, so any difference a listener hears is the path, not
the source.

```toml
[instance.sentences]
radio_id               = 13027161
slot1_tgid             = 9997
playlist_dir           = "/var/lib/sentences"
playlist_interval_secs = 30            # start to start
playlist_order         = "shuffle"     # or "sequential" (sorted by path)
playlist_pick          = 1             # >1: that many random files from ONE random
                                       #     subdirectory, in a single transmission
playlist_gap_ms        = 0             # silence between picked files
replay_delay_ms        = 0
max_capture_secs       = 10            # longest file it will play
# master_ip / master_port / passphrase as for a talkback
```

The files are in md380emu's `.amb` format: the 4-byte magic `.amb`, then one
8-byte record per 20 ms frame (a status byte, then the 49 AMBE bits MSB-first,
the last in byte 7's LSB). The player builds each call itself — voice header,
bursts A–F with voice sync and EMB headers, three AMBE frames per burst with
AMBE silence padding the last, terminator — and replays it through the same
rewrite and 60 ms clock as a talkback echo.

## Build and install

```sh
make
sudo make install          # /usr/local/bin/talkback, /etc/talkback/, systemd unit
```

`make install` never overwrites a live `talkback.toml`, and does not enable or
start the service. Edit the config, then:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now talkback
```

Run it in the foreground while you're setting it up:

```sh
./talkback -c talkback.toml --log-level DEBUG
```

## Connecting it

Where talkback runs on the same server as HBlink3/4, and those programs listen
on the loopback, connect to the loopback — it avoids extra overhead on the live
network port and keeps the passphrase off the wire.

**HBlink3** — point each instance at an **existing** `MODE: SERVER` system: its
`IP`, `PORT`, and `PASSPHRASE`. You don't create a system for the talkback unless
your intention is to have one that other systems bridge to on a specific TS/TGID.
It logs in as one more client of a system your repeaters already use, which is
what makes the service direct and unbridged.

Nothing else is needed, because a Server with `REPEAT: True` (the normal setting)
repeats every stream to its connected clients except the one it came from. A
repeater keys the talkback's talkgroup and the talkback hears it; the talkback
replays and every other client on that system hears it. That same
except-the-source rule is what keeps the replay from coming back into the
talkback. No bridge, no rules.

Check on the system you're joining:

- `REG_ACL` permits the talkback's radio ID to register
- `SUB_ACL` permits that ID as a source — it is the source of every replay
- `TGID_TS1_ACL` / `TGID_TS2_ACL` permit the talkback's talkgroup on its slot
- it consumes one of that system's `MAX_REPEATERS`

To cover several systems, run one instance per system. Bridging the talkback's
talkgroup in `rules.py` is only for the different case where you deliberately
want one talkback shared across systems.

**HBlink4** — add an access-control entry for the radio ID. The `Options=`
subscription handles the rest; no per-talkgroup server config is needed.

## Notes and limitations

- One call per slot at a time. A transmission arriving on a slot that is already
  playing back is ignored rather than truncating the echo. The other slot is
  unaffected.
- HBP only. There is no IPSC support; reach it through a bridge.
- No announcements, no ID lookups, no database, no dashboard. It records and it
  replays.

**If you hear nothing but the logs look perfect**, check the radio before the
software. Manual-dialing a talkgroup sets what you transmit to, but the
channel's **RX group list** is what decides whether the radio unmutes on
receive — so the call goes out, the echo comes back on the same talkgroup, and
the radio stays silent. Put the talkback's talkgroup in the RX group list, or
use a channel that already has it. A talkback call that reached the server logs
`*GROUP CALL START*` twice: once from your radio ID, then again ~2 s later from
the talkback's ID. If you see both, everything upstream of the radio is working.
